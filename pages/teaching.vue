                    <p>
                      Currently I am teaching JavaScript at City University of London. From time to time I also do private 
                      1:1 teaching/coaching for people who want to get from a zero level to hero. My idea is to get anyone with no background
                      in computing/programming and slowly progressed them to Frontend Developer position. 
                      Classes last for two hours and at the moment I am using Zoom and I can teach anyone around the world.
                      I offer two courses a starter and a more advanced:
                    </p>
                    <br />
                     <section>
                      <h2 class="title is-2">JS Starter</h2>

                      <p>
                          This is a course where we learn the basics of JS how to read/write/create/delete elements on the DOM. 
                          We learn about all the basics like arrays, variables and how to use them in real world examples. 
                          How to use functions and write good code that is within good standards. 
                          All my courses come with exercises that I give you for homework.
